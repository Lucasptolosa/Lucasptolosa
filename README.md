## Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

**Computer Engineering Student**

My name is <span style="color:#2e7d32;">**Lucas Paolillo Tolosa**</span>. I'm 18 years old and native of the city of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I graduated high school in Marista Arquidiocesano, and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering at Mackenzie Presbyterian University in SÃ£o Paulo. 

Since an early age I've been a tecnology enthusiest, I always knew I would work with coding, and with the recently innovations in the fild of development, I have only become more excited to work in the area!

Super excited to work with you! If interested, feel free to contact me by [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-tolosa-54a959358/) or Email!
